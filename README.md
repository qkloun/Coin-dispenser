# Coin Dispenser
A simple command-line tool that converts a dollar amount into the minimum number of U.S. coins (quarters, dimes, nickels, pennies). It reads a value from standard input, validates it (≤ 100 and non-negative), then prints how many of each coin you need. 

## Description
This coin dispenser program takes a monetary amount as input and breaks it down into the fewest possible coins using the standard US coin denominations:
<ul>
  <li>Quarters (25¢)</li>
  <li>Dimes (10¢)</li>
  <li>Nickels (5¢)</li>
  <li>Pennies (1¢)</li>
</ul>

The program uses a greedy algorithm approach, starting with the largest denomination and working down to ensure the minimum number of coins is used.
